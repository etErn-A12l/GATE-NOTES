### IP Address

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main functions: identifying the host or network interface and providing the location of the host in the network.

### Classes of IP Addresses

IP addresses are divided into five classes (A, B, C, D, and E) based on the first few bits of the address. Each class has a different range of addresses and is used for different purposes.

1. **Class A**:
   - **Range**: 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0
   - **Default Subnet Mask**: 255.0.0.0
   - **Network ID (NID)**: The first octet
   - **Host ID (HID)**: The last three octets
   - **Usage**: Large networks with many devices

2. **Class B**:
   - **Range**: 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0
   - **Default Subnet Mask**: 255.255.0.0
   - **Network ID (NID)**: The first two octets
   - **Host ID (HID)**: The last two octets
   - **Usage**: Medium-sized networks

3. **Class C**:
   - **Range**: 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0
   - **Default Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.0
   - **Network ID (NID)**: The first three octets
   - **Host ID (HID)**: The last octet
   - **Usage**: Small networks

4. **Class D**:
   - **Range**: 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
   - **Usage**: Multicast groups
   - **Note**: Class D addresses are not divided into network and host portions.

5. **Class E**:
   - **Range**: 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
   - **Usage**: Experimental purposes
   - **Note**: Class E addresses are not used for standard IP addressing.

### Network ID (NID) and Host ID (HID)

- **Network ID (NID)**: This part of the IP address identifies the specific network on which a device is located. It is used by routers to forward packets to the correct network.
- **Host ID (HID)**: This part of the IP address identifies the specific device (host) on the network. It is used to deliver packets to the correct device within the network.

### Subnetting

Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into smaller sub-networks (subnets). This is done by extending the default subnet mask to borrow bits from the host portion of the IP address to create additional network addresses.

- **Subnet Mask**: A 32-bit number that masks an IP address and divides the IP address into network and host portions. It is written in the same format as an IP address (e.g., 255.255.255.0).

### Example

Consider the IP address 192.168.1.10 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0:

- **Network ID (NID)**: 192.168.1.0
- **Host ID (HID)**: 10
- **Subnet Mask**: 255.255.255.0

### Other Details

- **Public IP Address**: An IP address that is accessible over the Internet. These addresses are assigned by ISPs and are unique across the entire Internet.
- **Private IP Address**: An IP address that is used within a private network. These addresses are not routable on the Internet and are used for internal communication within a network. Common ranges include:
  - 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
  - 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
  - 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255

- **Static IP Address**: An IP address that is manually assigned to a device and does not change.
- **Dynamic IP Address**: An IP address that is assigned by a DHCP server and can change over time.

Understanding IP addresses and their classes, along with subnetting, is crucial for network design, management, and troubleshooting.
